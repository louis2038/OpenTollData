                    OPEN DATA COMMONS
             OPEN DATABASE LICENSE (ODbL) v1.0

=======================================================================

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while
maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered
by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights.
Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights
that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too.
Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this
Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trademark over the name, or privacy rights), and so you are advised to
check what other rights may apply before using this license on the
Database.

Part I: Preamble

The goals of the Open Database License (ODbL) are:

- To promote the sharing of databases
- To allow freedom to use and modify databases
- To ensure that any modifications are shared equally

Part II: Your Rights

You are free:

- To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.
- To Create: To produce works from the database.
- To Adapt: To modify, transform and build upon the database.

As long as you:

- Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database,
  or works produced from the database, in the manner specified
  in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database,
  or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the
  license of the database and keep intact any notices on the
  original database.

- Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this
  database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must
  also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.

- Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted
  version of it, then you may use technological measures that
  restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute
  a version without such measures.

Part III: Disclaimer

THIS DATABASE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS DATABASE.
